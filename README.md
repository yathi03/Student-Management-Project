## Project Title
**Student Management System**

## Simple Overview
A basic Java application for managing student records, including adding, updating, and retrieving student details.

## Description
The **Student Management System** is a simple Java-based project that demonstrates how to manage a list of students by storing their details such as name, roll number, age, and more. This project includes two classes: 
- The **Student** class, which defines the structure and methods for managing individual student information.
- The **Test** class, which serves as the main application to interact with the system, allowing users to add, update, and view student records.

This project showcases key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and basic operations on data. It can be used as a foundation for more complex management systems.
